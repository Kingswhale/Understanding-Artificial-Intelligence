### Understanding-Artificial-Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex.
The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity.
AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.

### Goals

Aimed to provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. Help students, including those who do not plan to major in artificial intelligence, feel confident in their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. Also to position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.
